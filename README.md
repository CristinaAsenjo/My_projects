# My_projects
Here you can finde some of the projects I have carried out in the field of Artificial Intelligence are the followings:

- "Classification between beans and chickpeas": a project consisting of using images of chickpeas and beans to process the images by means of segmentation and thresholding in order to detect objects of interest. Once detected, the main characteristics are extracted and, by means of algorithms such as KNN or Bayes, a classifier is created to differentiate between chickpeas and beans. Finally, by using patterns, the positions of each of the objects of interest are extracted in order to communicate them to a robotic cell.

- "Aid system for cancerous tissues": Implementation in Python of a diagnostic aid system, based on image processing with OpenCV, to identify cancerous tissue samples.

- "Classification of glacier images": implementation of a classification system using convolutional networks of glacier images. Two strategies are used for this purpose, one in which the network is trained from scratch and the other in which transfer learning is used using pre-trained networks.

- "Control of an apod robot: Development of a mechanical and electronic design of an apod robot prototype. Implementation of a system for controlling the speed and direction of the prototype by means of Neural Networks. Validation of the study carried out on a real snake-robot prototype. The codes made to implement the snake-robot prototype and its control system based on a neural network are enclosed. The complete project report is also attached.
